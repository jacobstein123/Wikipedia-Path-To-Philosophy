Crawls Wikipedia to get the hyperlink path from a starting article to the Philosophy article

From [this article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy): 
>Clicking on the first link in the main text of a Wikipedia article, and then repeating the process for subsequent articles, usually eventually gets you to the Philosophy article. As of May 26, 2011, 94.52% of all articles in Wikipedia lead eventually to the article Philosophy. The remaining 100,000 (approx.) links to an article with no wikilinks or with links to pages that do not exist, or get stuck in loops (all three are equally probable). The median link chain length to reach philosophy is 23.
